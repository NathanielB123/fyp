\chapter{A Minimal Language with Smart Case}
\labch{scbool}

In this chapter, we introduce and study a minimal dependently-typed language
featuring a \SC-like elimination principle for Booleans. We name
this language \SCBool. We will also detail the core ideas behind my Haskell
typechecker for an extended version of this language.

When moving from STLC with local equations to dependent types, we note 
while equations of course must depend on the context (i.e. the LHS or RHS
terms can embed variables), it is also sometimes desirable for types
in the context to depend on local equations. For example, in a context
where we have|x ∶ 𝔹, y ∶ IF x 𝔹 A| and the (definitional) equation |x == TT| 
holds, we have |y ∶ 𝔹| (congruence of definitional equality), and so
ought to be able bind |z ∶ IF y B C|.

To support this, we fuse the ordinary and equational context: contexts
can now be extended either with types (introducing new variables) or
definitional equations (expanding conversion).

\section{Syntax}
\labsec{scboolsyntax}

We build upon our quotiented, explicit-substitution syntax 
laid out in \refsec{dtlc}. Again, we have four sorts:

\begin{spec}
  Ctx  : Set
  Ty   : Ctx → Set
  Tm   : ∀ Γ → Ty Γ → Set
  Tms  : Ctx → Ctx → Set
\end{spec}

\sideremark{In principle, we could also make type-level, ``large'' |IF|
``smart'' in the same way, adding equations to the contexts the LHS and RHS
types are defined in. We avoid considering this here only for simplicity.}

We carry over all the substitution laws, the existence of context extension
and the term/type formers associated with |Π| and |𝔹| types, except term-level
(dependent) |if|. In \SCBool, |if| will be ``smart'' in the sense that it will
add equations to the context in the left and right branches, as opposed
to requiring an explicit motive. 

We start by defining the obvious embedding of Booleans into \SCBool,
and prove the substitution law on embedded Booleans by cases.

\begin{code}
⌜_⌝𝔹 : Bool → Tm Γ 𝔹
⌜ true   ⌝𝔹 = TT
⌜ false  ⌝𝔹 = FF

⌜⌝𝔹[] : ⌜ b ⌝𝔹 [ δ ] ≡[ Tm≡ refl 𝔹[] ]≡ ⌜ b ⌝𝔹
⌜⌝𝔹[] {b = true}   = TT[]
⌜⌝𝔹[] {b = false}  = FF[]
\end{code}

%if False
\begin{code}

variable
  D E : Ty Γ

-- Basically just appealing to UIP
coh[][]  : ∀  {p : C ≡ B} {q : A [ δ ]Ty [ σ ]Ty ≡ C} 
              {r : D [ σ ]Ty ≡ B} {s : A [ δ ]Ty ≡ D}
         → subst (Tm Θ) p (subst (Tm Θ) q (t [ δ ] [ σ ])) 
         ≡ subst (Tm Θ) r (subst (Tm Δ) s (t [ δ ]) [ σ ])
coh[][] {p = refl} {q = q} {r = refl} {s = refl} rewrite q = refl

coh⌜⌝𝔹 : ∀ {A≡ : 𝔹 ≡[ Ty≡ Γ≡ ]≡ 𝔹}
       → ⌜ b ⌝𝔹 ≡[ Tm≡ Γ≡ A≡ ]≡ ⌜ b ⌝𝔹
coh⌜⌝𝔹 {Γ≡ = refl} {A≡ = refl} = refl
postulate
\end{code}
%endif

The key idea behind \SCBool is to allow extending contexts with
Boolean equations which we expect to hold definitionally.

\begin{code}
  _▷_>eq_  : ∀ Γ → Tm Γ 𝔹 → Bool → Ctx
\end{code}

% TODO: Huh???

  π₁eq⨾  : π₁eq (δ ⨾ σ) ≡ π₁eq δ ⨾ σ
\end{code}

% TODO: A proper explanation of how these substitutions work is probably
% warranted, lol
We define derived notions of weakening contexts by assuming new equations, 
|wkeq|, instantiating contextual equations with evidence of convertibility, 
|<_>eq|,
and finally functoriality of context extension by equations, |_^_>eq_|

\begin{code}
wkeq : Tms (Γ ▷ t >eq b) Γ
wkeq = π₁eq id

<_>eq : t ≡ ⌜ b ⌝𝔹 → Tms Γ (Γ ▷ t >eq b)
<_>eq {t = t} {b = b} t≡

  subst (Tm _) (sym [id]Ty ∙ 𝔹[]) ⌜ b ⌝𝔹
  ≡⟨ coh⌜⌝𝔹 {A≡ = sym [id]Ty ∙ 𝔹[]} ⟩≡

_^_>eq_  : ∀ (δ : Tms Δ Γ) t b
         → Tms (Δ ▷ subst (Tm Δ) 𝔹[] (t [ δ ]) >eq b) (Γ ▷ t >eq b)

  =    (δ ⨾ wkeq) 
  ,eq  (subst (Tm _) 𝔹[] (t [ δ ⨾ wkeq ])
       ≡⟨ cong (subst (Tm _) 𝔹[]) (sym [][]) ⟩≡

       ≡⟨ coh[][] {p = 𝔹[]} ⟩≡

       ≡⟨ π₂eq id ⟩≡
       ⌜ b ⌝𝔹 ∎)
\end{code}

We also prove some equations about how these new substitution operations
commute.

\begin{code}
wk^    : wkeq ⨾ (δ ^ t >eq b) ≡ δ ⨾ wkeq

wk<>eq    : ∀ {t≡ : t ≡ ⌜ b ⌝𝔹} → wkeq ⨾ < t≡ >eq ≡ id {Γ = Γ}

\end{code}

As with our simply-typed equational contexts, \SCBool contexts can become
definitionally inconsistent, and collapse the definitional equality.

\begin{definition}[Definitional context inconsistency] \phantom{a}\\\\
An \SCBool context is considered def.-inconsistent iff under that
context, |TT| and |FF| are convertible.

\begin{code}
incon : Ctx → Set
incon Γ = _≡_ {A = Tm Γ 𝔹} TT FF
\end{code}
\end{definition}

% TODO: We should probably move this earlier
% Importantly, note that |incon| is derivable even when all equations in the
% context individually are not def.-inconsistent (i.e. are not
% |TT >rw false| or |FF >rw true|). For example 
% |Γ = (x : 𝔹) ▷ x >rw true ▷ (λ y. y) x >rw false|. Deciding definitional
% (in)consistency of contexts relies on at least normalisation (really, 
% completion) and so pre-conditions relating to such a principle in the syntax
% are likely to cause issues. 

% TODO Have now moved this earlier. Let's just ref (maybe remind in the margin?)

\begin{definition}[Equality collapse]\phantom{a}

In the setting of dependent types, we define our usual notion of 
equality collapse to be at the level of types.

\begin{code}
collapse : Ctx → Set
collapse Γ = ∀ (A B : Ty Γ) → A ≡ B
\end{code}
\end{definition}

Equality collapses in definitionally inconsistent contexts by the same
argument as usual (building a chain of equations 
{|u ≡ if TT u v ≡ if FF u v ≡ v|}, but this time using large |IF|).

\begin{code}
incon-collapse : incon Γ → collapse Γ
incon-collapse Γ! A B = 
  A
  ≡⟨ sym IF-TT ⟩≡
  IF TT A B
  ≡⟨ cong (λ □ → IF □ A B) Γ! ⟩≡
  IF FF A B
  ≡⟨ IF-FF ⟩≡
  B ∎
\end{code}

\begin{example}[Definitional Inconsistency Enables Self-Application] \phantom{a}
\labexample{definconselfapp}

Equality collapse at the type level is more dangerous than the simply-typed
analogue. Under definitional equality of all types, we have that, e.g.
|A ⇒ A == A|, which means we can type self-application and easily write
looping terms such as {|(ƛ (x ∶ A). x x) (ƛ (x ∶ A). x x)|}.

\begin{code}
_[_]! : incon Γ → Tms Δ Γ → incon Δ
Γ! [ δ ]! = 
  TT
  ≡⟨ sym[] TT[] ⟩≡ 
  subst (Tm _) 𝔹[] (TT [ δ ])
  ≡⟨ cong (subst (Tm _) 𝔹[]) (Γ! [ refl ]≡') ⟩≡ 
  subst (Tm _) 𝔹[] (FF [ δ ])
  ≡⟨ FF[] ⟩≡ 
  FF ∎

self-app : incon Γ → Tm Γ (Π A (A [ wk ]Ty))
self-app {A = A} Γ! 
  = ƛ subst  (Tm _) wk<>Ty 
             (subst (Tm _) (incon-collapse (Γ! [ wk ]!) _ _) vz · vz)
\end{code}
\end{example}


% TODO GO BACK TO OLD EQUALITY COLLAPSE DISCUSSION AND AMEND THAT ACTUALLY
% NORMALISATION IN THE PRESENCE OF INCONSISTENCY ISN'T GAME OVER

We can of course also derive that definitionally inconsistent contexts
collapse the term equality also, though dealing with the explicit substitutions
clutters the argument somewhat.

For example, the |u| and |v| inside the |if| must be weakened to account for 
the new 
local equation, and contracting the |if| requires explicitly instantiating this
equation with a substitution. Our |wk<>eq| lemma from earlier is exactly
what we need to show that the composition of these two actions has
no ultimate effect.

% Given |_≡_ {A = Tm Γ 𝔹} TT ≡ FF|, we are tasked with proving 
% |t ≡ u| for arbitrary terms |t u : Tm Γ A|. The key idea is to follow the chain
% of equations |t ≡ if TT then t else u ≡ if FF then t else u ≡ u|, but we must
% take care to account for explicit substitution and weakening. 
% 
% E.g. The |t| and |u| inside the |if| must be weakened to account for the new 
% rewrite, and contracting the |if| requires explicitly instantiating this
% rewrite with another substitution. Our |wk<>eq| lemma from earlier is exactly
% what we need to show that these substitutions ultimately have no effect.

\begin{code}
tm-collapse : Ctx → Set

\section{Soundness}

We prove soundness of \SCBool by updating the standard model construction 
given in \refsec{depsound}.

%if False
\begin{code}
variable 
  ⟦Γ⟧ : ⟦Ctx⟧
  ⟦A₁⟧ ⟦A₂⟧ : ⟦Ty⟧ ⟦Γ⟧
  ρ : ⟦Γ⟧
\end{code}

\begin{code}
Ty≡-inst : ⟦A₁⟧ ≡ ⟦A₂⟧ → ⟦A₁⟧ ρ ≡ ⟦A₂⟧ ρ
Ty≡-inst refl = refl
\end{code}
%endif



The model gets a little more interesting for \SCBool though. Our metatheory
does not feature a ``first-class'' definitional equality, so we instead
interpret definitional contextual equalities propositionally (i.e.
{⟦ Γ ▷ t >eq b ⟧Ctx == ⟦ Γ ▷ Id 𝔹 t ⌜ b ⌝𝔹 ⟧Ctx}).

\begin{spec}
⟦ Γ ▷ t >eq b ⟧Ctx = Σ⟨ ρ ∶ ⟦ Γ ⟧Ctx ⟩× ⟦ t ⟧Tm ρ ≡ b

⟦ π₁eq δ ⟧Tms = λ ρ → ⟦ δ ⟧Tms ρ .fst  
\end{spec}

When interpreting |_,eq_|, we split on the particular Boolean RHS
so the substitution
on it computes definitionally (slightly simplifying the equational reasoning,
at the cost of having to repeat it).

\begin{spec}
⟦ _,eq_ {t = t} {b = true} δ t≡  ⟧Tms 
  = λ ρ  → ⟦ δ ⟧Tms ρ
         Σ, cong-app 
         (⟦ t [ δ ] ⟧Tm
         ≡⟨ sym (coh⟦⟧Tm {t = t [ δ ]} {A≡ = 𝔹[]} {⟦A⟧≡ = refl}) ⟩≡
         ⟦ subst (Tm _) 𝔹[] (t [ δ ]) ⟧Tm
         ≡⟨ cong ⟦_⟧Tm t≡ ⟩≡
         ⟦ TT ⟧Tm ∎) ρ
⟦ _,eq_ {t = t} {b = false} δ t≡  ⟧Tms 
  = λ ρ  → ⟦ δ ⟧Tms ρ
         Σ, cong-app 
         (⟦ t [ δ ] ⟧Tm
         ≡⟨ sym (coh⟦⟧Tm {t = t [ δ ]} {A≡ = 𝔹[]} {⟦A⟧≡ = refl}) ⟩≡
         ⟦ subst (Tm _) 𝔹[] (t [ δ ]) ⟧Tm
         ≡⟨ cong ⟦_⟧Tm t≡ ⟩≡
         ⟦ FF ⟧Tm ∎) ρ
\end{spec}

To interpret ``smart'' |if|, we define an analagous operation in our metatheory
that takes a propositional equality instead: the Boolean ``splitter''.

% TODO: This could maybe go in the preliminaries/related work...
% I.e. to explain why Smart Case cannot replace induction principles
\sideremark{For all finite types |A|, the ``splitter'' and eliminator
are equally powerful.\\To derive the splitter, splitting on
a scrutinee {|x ∶ A|}, 
producing a type |B|, from the eliminator, we
instantiate the motive {|P ∶ A → Set|} with {|P y = x ≡ y → B|}.
The eliminator's methods then exactly correspond to the splitter's cases, 
and passing
{|refl ∶ x ≡ x|} to the result of eliminating gets back to type |B|.\\To
derive the eliminator from the splitter, we instead instantiate
{|B = P x|}, and transport the appropriate over the provided 
propositional equality in each case.\\Of course, splitters cannot induct,
so the splitter for infinitary types like |ℕ| is weaker than the 
associated eliminator.}

%if False
\begin{code}
module _ {A : Set} where
\end{code}
%endif

\begin{code}
  Bool-split : (b : Bool) → (b ≡ true → A) → (b ≡ false → A) → A
  Bool-split true   t f = t refl
  Bool-split false  t f = f refl
\end{code}

\begin{spec}
⟦ if t u v ⟧Tm = λ ρ → Bool-split  (⟦ t ⟧Tm ρ) 
                                   (λ t≡ → ⟦ u ⟧Tm (ρ Σ, t≡)) 
                                   (λ t≡ → ⟦ v ⟧Tm (ρ Σ, t≡))
\end{spec}

Finally, to ensure soundness, we also need to show that conversion is preserved.
The updated computation rules for |if| still hold definitionally in 
the meta, but the new |π₂eq| law does not. We need to
manually project out the propositional equality from the substituted
environment, but to do this, we need to get our hands on an environment
to substitute (alternatively: evaluate the substitutes in). For this, we 
need function
extensionality (also, we again split on the Boolean to simplify the reasoning):

\begin{spec}
⟦ π₂eq {t = t} {b = true} δ   ⟧Tm =
  ⟦ subst (Tm _) 𝔹[] (t [ π₁eq δ ]) ⟧Tm
  ≡⟨ coh⟦⟧Tm {t = t [ π₁eq δ ]} {A≡ = 𝔹[]} {⟦A⟧≡ = refl} ⟩≡

\end{code}
%endif

Soundness itself than holds as usual: by passing the empty environment to
the interpreted proof of |𝟘|:

\begin{code}
sound : ¬ Tm • (Id 𝔹 TT FF)
sound t = tt/ff-disj (⟦ t ⟧Tm tt)
\end{code}

\section{Normalisation Challenges}
\labsec{scboolnormfail}

Normalisation of \SCBool is tricky. From our simply-typed
investigations in \refch{simply}, we already know that completing sets 
of equations 
(that is, turning them into confluent, terminating, rewriting systems) 
is essential
to decide equivalence under equational assumptions, and that when
such equations can be introduced locally, normalisation and
completion must be interleaved.

In \SCBool, 
checking whether the equational context can be completed before reducing
is even more important, given under definitionally inconsistent contexts,
terms that loop w.r.t. β-reduction can be defined 
\refexample{definconselfapp}. 
This means we need to be careful to only
ever reduce terms after we have completed at least the set of equations that
their typing directly depends on.


% Still, in the presence of non-confluent rewrite lies trouble. |b >rw true|
% and |b >rw false| together enables self-application without either equation
% alone being obviously inconsistent. Of course, this can in principle 
% be obscured further by using LHSs which are still definitionally equal, but only
% via several reduction steps. To avoid problems, we at least need to ensure 
% that we only ever attempt to reduce terms
% (including rewrite LHSs) once all the equations they depend on
% to typecheck have been mutually completed. We leave the problem of

\subsection{Type Theory Modulo (Boolean) Equations}

\sideremark{Note that difficulties associated with completion can in principle
be avoided by requiring the set of equations to satisfy completion criteria
by construction. In this setting, our problem here is effectively a special
case of \sidecite[*4]{cockx2021taming}.\\
Unfortunately, when moving to locally-introduced equations, relying on
the LHSs all being mutually irreducible is not really feasible. As we
will discuss in \refsec{depbeyondbool}, any restrictions on equations 
must be stable under substitution, and irreducibility of LHSs does not
satisfy this criteria.}

A nice first-step towards normalisation for \SCBool would be
to attempt to prove decidability of conversion for for dependent types
modulo a fixed (global) set of Boolean equations. We can arrive at an explicit 
syntax for this problem by just replacing \SCBool's ``smart |if|'' with the
ordinary dependent one\remarknote{Note that in such a setting, we can consider
a vastly restricted subset of \SCBool's substitutions, where the sub-context
up to the last equational assumption always remains constant, and no new
equations can be added.\\
Specifically, we can define restricted weakenings which only
append types (never equations) to the context, then replace the 
terminal substitution |ε : Tms Δ •| with an embedding of these weakenings.

  ε′    : Wk Δ Γ → Tms′ Δ Γ
\end{code}
\resetcodeindent
We also should change |_,eq_|, |π₁eq| and |π₂eq|. General substitutions
should not be able to extend the context with new equations, but we do still
want equations defined earlier in the context to apply everywhere, so switching
back to a de Bruijn variable-like |EqVar| rule for reflecting equational
assumptions seems natural.
%TODO Code for this??
}.

A natural strategy here is to make an attempt at adapting our
simply-typed result from \refsec{simplenormcompl}. 
Unfortunately, it seems
impossible to reuse the same techniques. For starters,
non-deterministic reduction on dependent |if| does not preserve typing.
Recall that in the definition of |if|

\begin{spec}
if  : ∀ (A : Ty (Γ ▷ 𝔹)) (t : Tm Γ 𝔹) 
      → Tm Γ (A [ < TT > ]Ty) → Tm Γ (A [ < FF > ]Ty)
      → Tm Γ (A [ < t > ]Ty)
\end{spec}

the LHS and RHS have type {|A [ < TT > ]|} and {|A [ < FF > ]Ty|} respectively,
while the overall expression instead has type {|A [ < t > ]Ty|} (where |t|
is the scrutinee).

Actually, the problem is more
fundamental: we can construct terms in dependent type 
theory (with just with ordinary, dependent |if|) that, after projecting out the 
untyped term, 
loop w.r.t. non-deterministic (or spontaneous) reduction. 
For example (working internally, in a context where |b ∶ 𝔹| and
|x ∶ A| for some type |A|), the following term is typeable with 
|IF b A (A ⇒ A) ⇒ A|.

\begin{spec}
ƛ (y ∶ IF b A (A ⇒ A)). 
  (if [b′. IF b′ A (A ⇒ A) ⇒ A ⇒ A]  b (ƛ _. x)  y)
  (if [b′. IF b′ A (A ⇒ A) ⇒ A]      b y         x)
\end{spec}

The untyped projection of this term is just

\begin{spec}
ƛ y. (if b (ƛ _. x) y) (if b y x)
\end{spec}

Under non-deterministic reduction, we can collapse the first |if| the 
right branch (|y|), and the second |if| the left branch (also, |y|) 
resulting in |ƛ y. y y| (and under spontaneous
reduction, we can do the same thing in two steps, but first collapsing the 
scrutinee the the appropriate closed Boolean). We then just need to repeat
the same construction, replacing |A| with |IF b A (A ⇒ A) ⇒ A|, and we are left
with (after erasing types)

\begin{spec}
(ƛ y. (if b (ƛ _. x) y) (if b y x)) (ƛ y. (if b (ƛ _. x) y) (if b y x))
\end{spec}

which (spontaneously or non-deterministically) reduces down to Ω

\begin{spec}
(ƛ y. y y) (ƛ y. y y)
\end{spec}

This puts us essentially back to square-one. We know to normalise 
\SCBool, we need to do completion, but completion can only be justified by
making progress w.r.t. to
some well-founded order, and our best candidate from STLC does not work. 
I think one potential route forwards could be to define a TRS
for an \SCBool context as a list of Boolean rewrites, plus a small-step
relation covering the steps of completion (reducing a LHS, removing 
a redundant equation, concluding definitional inconsistency from an inconsistent
one). We could then aim to prove that 


\subsection{Beyond Booleans}

A major motivating factor for my ``giving-up'' on \SCBool (on top of the
challenges previously listed) is that going far beyond Boolean equations appears
impossible.

As covered in \refsec{screflect}, when we start generalising \SC, it is
useful to view it from the lens of restricted equality reflection. 
A significant issue with syntaxes that introduce equations locally,
such as \SCBool, is that the restrictions we enforce on propositional
equalities that may be reflected must be stable under substitution. This
is a consequence of being able to introduce equations underneath λ-abstractions
and featuring definitional β-reduction: if the equation restriction is not
stable under substitution, then β-reduction could take a well-typed term
that reflects a valid equation, and reduce it to a term where the 
reflected equation is no longer valid.

\subsubsection{Neutral Types}

This has significant consequences. One set of equations we may 
aim to
support are equations between neutral terms of neutral type. 
For example,
in a context with variables {|b ∶ 𝔹|} and {|x ∶ IF b A B|},
such that the term {|t ∶ Π b. IF b A B|} is typeable (and |t b| is neutral),
we might want to reflect the equation {|t b == x|}. However, if we then
applied the substitution {|TT / b|}, we get the new equation
{|t TT == x|}, where both sides now have type |A|. 
This was possible for any type |A| and term |t| that blocks on its argument,
so for example, we could make this example more concrete by setting
{|A = ℕ ⇒ 𝔹|} and {|t = ƛ b. if [b′. IF b′ (ℕ ⇒ 𝔹) B] b u v|}. Now,
|t TT| β-reduces to |u|, an arbitrary |ℕ ⇒ 𝔹|-typed term.
As mentioned in \refsec{loceqreflect}, reflecting equations higher-order-typed
equations like this quickly leads to undecidability. Therefore, we must prevent
|u == x|, and so to ensure stability under substitution, we must also
reject the original |t b == x| equation. In practice, I argue this example
is repeatable for pretty-much all equations of neutral 
type\remarknote{The main exception that I can think of is equations typed with
large |⊥-elim|. As |⊥-elim| has no computation rules, it cannot possibly
reduce down to a higher order type. Technically, I suppose one could also look
into the branches of |IF| to see if all branches return first-order types,
and design a restriction based on that.}.

\sideremark{A more skeptical reader might wonder whether our desire here -
i.e. reflecting neutral equations - is at all
realistic. I reply ``yes, because I have found a way to do it!'' and 
``skip ahead to the next chapter to see how!''}
In our minimal type theory, where the only neutral types can be constructed
out of large |IF|, perhaps this does not seem so important. One should consider
though, that in theories with type variables, equations of neutral 
type are extremely common. Consider, for example, code that is
generic over a functor, |F : Type → Type|. Note the functor laws such
as {|fmap-id : fmap id xs ≡ xs|} are all at neutral type. While our focus on
manual equality reflection of individual propositional equalities does not 
aim for quite the same convenience as building the functor equations into
the typechecker (i.e. we still need to manually instantiate the particular
functor law with our particular |F A|-typed term), we argue that this kind of
automation would still go a long way towards resolving the issues that
motivated work such as \sidecite{allais2013new}. Being restricted only to
Boolean equations is unnacceptable!

\subsubsection{Finitary Types}

It is probably worth mentioning that going a little beyond our Boolean equations
is likely achievable though. The first obvious equality-reflection-motivated 
generalisation is to allow equations between |𝔹|-typed neutral terms. Assuming
a normalisation proof of \SCBool based on completion, extending it to 
account for neutral rewrites, oriented w.r.t. some term ordering should not be
challenging (neutral equations are arguably better-behaved than 
ones ending in closed Booleans, given they cannot unblock new |β|-reductions).

By extending our language with dependent pairs (|Σ|-types) with strict |η|, 
we also get sum/coproduct-typed equations ``for free'' via a similar argument to 
\sidecite{kovacs2022strong}. Specifically, we can define sums/coproducts
with Boolean large elimination like so
\begin{spec}
A + B = Σ (b ∶ 𝔹). IF b A B

in₁  t = tt  , t
in₂  t = ff  , t
\end{spec}
Equations of the form |t == in₁ u| at type |A + B| can now be decomposed into 
a Boolean equation |π₁ t == true| and a |A|-typed equation |π₂ t == u|. 
Of course, this approach only works if the |A|-typed equation is itself
valid, and equations between neutrals |t == u|
of type |A + B| are unfortunately a bit more problematic:
the first |π₁ t == π₂ u| component
is fine, assuming validity of neutral Boolean equations, but |π₂ t == π₂ u|
has type |if b A B| - this is a neutral equation of neutral type, which as 
explained above, is hard to justify.

\subsubsection{Infinitary Types}

We finally spend a bit of time considering infinitary types.

TODO - INFINITARY TYPES (I HAVE SOME REALLY OLD NOTES ON DISCORD USING A 
DEDICATED FIXPOINT TYPE THAT I COULD TALK ABOUT HERE)

\section{Typechecking Smart Case}

We end this section with a description of the \SCBool typechecker implemented
in Haskell as a component of this project. As explained previously in 
\refsec{scboolnormfail}, I do not know how to prove normalisation of
\SCBool, and therefore do not claim that this typechecker is complete.
In practice though, it does appear capable of handling some of the
\SC use-cases identified in (TODO REF HERE), including


\subsection{Bi-directional Typechecking}

The key motivation behind bi-directional typechecking is to reduce 
annotation-burden on programs written in the surface language.
Its inference capabilities our ultimate more limited than
e.g. metavariables, but its behaviour is also much more predictable.

For example, Agda is capable of successfully elaborating 

\begin{code}
foo = λ x → x +ℕ 1
\end{code}

without any type annotations, while under the bi-directional discipline, 
un-annotated |λ| abstraction cannot, in general, synthesise a type,
so we must ask for an annotation here.

Note that Agda does not successfully elaborate the un-annotated identity 
function (instead reporting the existence of unsolved metavariables).

\begin{spec}
bar = λ x → x
\end{spec}

\subsection{Hasochism and Well-scoped Syntax}



\subsection{Efficient Normalisation by Evaluation}

\subsection{``Inductively''-defined Values}

TODO! The general idea is defining values as a non-positive datatype
with e.g. constructors like |VLam : Ren → Val → Val| instead of by recursion 
on object types (which isn't really possible in a non-dependently-typed
setting).

\subsection{Avoiding Quotation during Evaluation}

TODO! The general idea is to define ``neutral values'', which are also
non-positive, but by examining the algorithm we can see that the operational 
behaviour ends up the same.

Should probably also discuss how it is possible to decide conversion on
values directly (i.e. fusing conversion-checking and quoting).

\subsection{De Bruijn Levels}

TODO! General idea is to represent variables in values with de Bruijn 
\textit{levels} rather than \textit{indices}, such that variables count the
number of binders between their binding site and the root of the term (rather
than their binding site and their use). This makes inserting fresh variables
(i.e. the presheaf stuff we needed for quoting to work) no longer require
a full traversal of the value.


\subsection{Meta vs First-Order Closures}

TODO! I don't currently plan on implementing this optimisation, but it
is still probably worth mentioning.
It turns out the operational behaviour of the NbE algorithm can be replicated
without meta-language closures entirely! Closures can be represented in
a first-order fashion by pairing un-evaluated terms and captured environments.
This variation is no longer structurally recursive (we need to |eval| the
closure bodies during applications, similarly to naive normalisation)
but can be faster on than relying on meta-closures depending on implementation
language/runtime.

\subsection{Supporting Local Equations}

Now we have sufficient background in NbE as implemented in the \SCBool
typechecker. We explain the tweaks to the algorithm made to support
local equations (arising from ``smart'' |if|).

TODO! The general idea is just to track a map of neutrals to values and
lookup neutrals in the map when necessary. Function values need to be
parameterised by updated maps to reduce properly in contexts with new equations.
